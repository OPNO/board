## BOD Resolution: Tainted RHOC Amendment

Whereas RChain Cooperative has not supported the development of secondary markets involving the RHOC token, we recognize that many people have still traded on exchanges. Rather than impact innocent parties who may have received tainted RHOC from exchanges, the Cooperative will not run the taint analysis, but simply recover the RHOC by setting the following balances at Genesis:
