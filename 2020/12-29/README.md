## Resolution: Q4 REV Sale

#### On a motion by Greg Meredith, and seconded by Steve Ross-Talbot, it was moved to offer the following sale to *ID-verified Co-op members only*:

As of today the Co-op has achieved code completion of the block-merge feature, and the code is now going into testing and optimization. We are confident that block-merge will be implemented on the mainnet on or before the end of Q1 2021.

Special sale offer beginning 00:00 PST 30 December 2020, and concluding 00:00 PST 18 January 2021:

-   10 Million REV on offer at $0.05 per REV.
    
-   Buy 1 REV and receive a bonus 1 REV at mainnet block-merge release. 

    -   Your REV will be staked until the end of the Epoch in which block-merge is delivered. (estimated end of March 2021)
    
    -   The bonus REV will be staked until the end of the Epoch following the delivery of block-merge. (estimated end of July 2021)

-   **For every 1 REV sold, 15 REV of the Co-op’s REV reserve will be locked up in staking.**
    
-   Minimum purchase is 2.07 ETH or 0.056 BTC.

Guarantee:

- If block-merge is not implemented on main-net by the end of Q1 2021, the Co-op will refund 33% of the ETH, or BTC paid (not dollar value).
