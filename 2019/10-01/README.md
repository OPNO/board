## Continue Co-op Operations

Steve Ross-Talbot seconded the motion, and all directors present voted "yes".

Steve Ross-Talbot agrees to begin working full time for the Co-op 3 days a week, without additional compensation, to develop a business development road-map, until assuming the role of interim president after the launch of main-net.

Greg Meredith agrees with Evan Jensen's request to promptly notify all directors if at any time the Co-op is in jeopardy of not fulfilling a main-net launch before November 24.
