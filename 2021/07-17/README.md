## Resolution: REV Distribution Policy at Hard Forks
On a motion by Greg Meredith, and seconded by Evan Jensen, it was moved to adopt the following policy:

If software authored by the Cooperative fails, resulting in REV being made inaccessible (burnt), at the nearest hard fork the Co-op will consider sweeping the balances of the burnt addresses into a Co-op escrow wallet; and in no other cases will the Cooperative modify REV distribution at a hard fork.

All board members present voted “Aye”. \
The motion was carried unanimously.
